# PRFX

Prounounced "Pr(e)f(i)x".

Command line tool to automatically add browser/web engine specific prefixes for common CSS modifiers transform and transition (i.e. `-webkit-`, `-moz-`, and `-ms-`).

Usage: `prfx style.css`, output file will be `prfxd_style.css` in same folder. If you honestly don't know how to move that file to how you need it (a.k.a. rename it) then you shouldn't even need this tool because you don't know what the actual fuck it does.

<b>_Still in development._</b>
